    "content": "<div class=\"content\"><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Intro</h2><p>  We’ve all been there: you’ve been coding away in React with Typescript  enjoying type-checking until it’s time to time to integrate your application  with an API. And then, all of your data types are wrong, ending up with a  ton of errors, or just not working at all. Thankfully, integrating APIs  doesn’t need to be complicated with GraphQL. It enables you to quickly get  an API integrated without the hassle of a standard REST API, thanks to tools  like Codegen.</p><p>  In this article, I will demonstrate the problem that many developers face  and how to improve the workflow when integrating your react app with a  GraphQL API.</p><p>  <em    >This tutorial assumes that you have abeen working with React before and    want to improve, so you already have your workstation set up.</em  ></p><figure class=\"wp-block-image\">  <a    href=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ewZruGD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/coswyh37xvdaji4yv0ez.png\"    ><img      decoding=\"async\"      src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8ewZruGD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/coswyh37xvdaji4yv0ez.png\"      alt=\"GraphQL Meme\"  /></a></figure><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What We Will Do:</h3><ul>  <li><strong>Bootstrap</strong>&nbsp;a new Next.js TypeScript project</li>  <li>    <strong>Install</strong>&nbsp;Apollo GraphQL and fetch data from a public    API  </li>  <li>    <strong>Showcase</strong>&nbsp;why using GraphQL Codegen is a good idea  </li>  <li>    <strong>Create</strong>&nbsp;a Next.js API endpoint for sending emails    with data  </li>  <li>    <strong      >Use the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://novu.co/\">Novu.co</a      >&nbsp;platform</strong    >&nbsp;for setting up and sending emails to a given email  </li></ul><p>  <em    >If you want to skip the writeup, you can go to GitHub directly and look    at the code:&nbsp;<a      href=\"https://github.com/ugglr/next-typescript-graphql-integration\"      >https://github.com/ugglr/next-typescript-graphql-integration</a    ></em  ></p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">  Creating an Example Project with React and Next.js</h2><p>  Learning is faster when you get your hands dirty, so let’s jump straight in.  We’ll bootstrap a new React project using Next.js with Typescript. Next.js  is a full-stack framework for React that allows us to quickly start up a web  app.</p><p>  Run the following command in your terminal to scaffold a new Next.js project  with Typescript:</p><pre  class=\"prismjs scrollbar-hidden h-full overflow-auto p-8 text-base font-normal md:p-6 md:!text-sm sm:p-4\"><code class=\"language-bash\" style=\"white-space: pre;\"><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 1.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">1</span><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span><span class=\"\"> create next-app --typescript</span></code></pre><p>  It will then prompt you for the name of the project. Let’s name  it&nbsp;<code>next-typescript-graphql-integration</code>&nbsp;so we know  what we’re working with, and we’ll leave anything else to default values.</p><p>  While we’re still in the terminal, navigate to our newly created project and  run it to make sure that the installation was successful.</p><pre  class=\"prismjs scrollbar-hidden h-full overflow-auto p-8 text-base font-normal md:p-6 md:!text-sm sm:p-4\"><code class=\"language-bash\" style=\"white-space: pre;\"><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 1.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">1</span><span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span><span class=\"\"> next-typescript-graphql-integration</span></br><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 1.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">2</span></br><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 1.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">3</span><span class=\"\"></span><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span><span class=\"\"> dev</span></code></pre><p>The output will be similar to this:</p><pre  class=\"prismjs scrollbar-hidden h-full overflow-auto p-8 text-base font-normal md:p-6 md:!text-sm sm:p-4\"><code class=\"language-bash\" style=\"white-space: pre;\"><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 2.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">1</span><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span><span class=\"\"> dev</span></br><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 2.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">2</span><span class=\"\"></span><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span><span class=\"\"> run v1.22.15</span></br><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 2.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">3</span>$ next dev</br><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 2.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">4</span><span class=\"\">ready - started server on </span><span class=\"token number\">0.0</span><span class=\"\">.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000</span></br><span class=\"comment linenumber react-syntax-highlighter-line-number\" style=\"display: inline-block; min-width: 2.25em; padding-right: 1em; text-align: right; user-select: none;\">5</span><span class=\"\">event - compiled client and server successfully </span><span class=\"token keyword\">in</span><span class=\"\"> </span><span class=\"token number\">1457</span><span class=\"\"> ms </span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">165</span><span class=\"\"> modules</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre><p>  From this, we can determine that the page is available  at&nbsp;<strong>localhost:3000</strong>.
